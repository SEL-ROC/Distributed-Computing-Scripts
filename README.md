‚ù§Ô∏è Please visit [tealdulcet.com](https://www.tealdulcet.com/) to support these scripts and my other software development.

## Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)

üÜï Thanks to Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (Colab) service, anyone with an internet connection can now contribute to GIMPS for üÜì, without downloading or installing anything! Please see our [google-colab](google-colab) directory for instructions.

### Prime95/MPrime

Downloads, sets up and runs [Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/#download). Supports only x86 CPUs.

```
wget https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/mprime.sh -qO - | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run (mins)]
```

To run Prime95 for Stress/Torture Testing, see the [Testing and Benchmarking](https://github.com/tdulcet/Testing-and-Benchmarking-Scripts) scripts.

### CUDALucas

Downloads, builds, sets up and runs [CUDALucas](https://sourceforge.net/p/cudalucas/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/). Downloads, sets up and runs our [PrimeNet Python script](#primenet) for automated PrimeNet assignments.

```
wget https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/cudalucas.sh -qO - | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run (mins)]
```

### Mlucas

Downloads, builds, sets up and runs [Mlucas](https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html#download1). Downloads, sets up and runs our [PrimeNet Python script](#primenet) for automated PrimeNet assignments. Supports x86 Intel and AMD and ARM CPUs, but only recommended for ARM CPUs, which [Prime95/MPrime](#prime95mprime) does not support. Prime95/MPrime is faster than Mlucas on x86 CPUs. Run: `wget https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Linux-System-Information/master/info.sh -qO - | bash -s` to output your system information, including CPU and architecture.
This script follows the recommended instructions on the [Mlucas README](https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html) for each architecture and CPU.

```
wget https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/mlucas.sh -qO - | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run (mins)]
```

### PrimeNet

Automatically gets assignments, reports assignment results and optionally progress to PrimeNet for the GpuOwl, CUDALucas and Mlucas GIMPS programs. Supports both Python 2 and 3 and Windows, macOS and Linux. Requires the [Requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/), which is included with many Python 3 installations. The script will automatically install Requests on first run if it is not already installed. GIMPS [discontinued first time LL assignments](https://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=26682) in April 2021, although the script [still supports them](https://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?p=575260#post575260) for users of CUDALucas or with limited disk space. Our [GpuOwl](#gpuowl), [CUDALucas](#cudalucas) and [Mlucas](#mlucas) Linux scripts automatically download, setup and run this. Adapted from the PrimeNet Python script from [Mlucas](https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html#download2) by [Lo√Øc Le Loarer](https://github.com/llloic11/primenet) and Ernst W. Mayer, which itself was adapted from primetools by [Mark Rose](https://github.com/MarkRose/primetools) and [teknohog](https://github.com/teknohog/primetools).

#### Usage

```
Usage: primenet.py [options]

This program will automatically get assignments, report assignment results and
optionally progress to PrimeNet for the GpuOwl, CUDALucas and Mlucas GIMPS
programs. It also saves its configuration to a ‚Äúlocal.ini‚Äù file, so it is only
necessary to give most of the arguments the first time it is run. The first
time it is run, if a password is NOT provided, it will register the current
GpuOwl/CUDALucas/Mlucas instance with PrimeNet (see below). Then, it will get
assignments, report the results and progress, if registered, to PrimeNet on a
‚Äútimeout‚Äù interval, or only once if timeout is 0.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit

  -t TIMEOUT, --timeout=TIMEOUT
                        Seconds to wait between network updates, Default: 3600
                        seconds (1 hour). Use 0 for a single update without
                        looping.

                        dates for all assignments and exit.
  --unreserve_all       Unreserve all assignments and exit. Requires that the
                        instance is registered with PrimeNet.

  Registering Options: sent to PrimeNet/GIMPS when registering. The progress will automatically be sent and the program can then be monitored on the GIMPS website CPUs page (https://www.mersenne.org/cpus/), just like with Prime95/MPrime. This also allows for the program to get much smaller Category 0 and 1 exponents, if it meets the other requirements (https://www.mersenne.org/thresholds/).:

* Add a quit GIMPS feature, where it will not download any new assignments, but will still finish and report the existing ones.
* Support reporting interim residues.
* Support downloading certification assignments.
* Adapt Lo√Øc Le Loarer's [test suite](https://github.com/llloic11/primenet/tree/main/tests).

General:
* Create install script for the [GpuOwl](https://github.com/preda/gpuowl) GIMPS program
* Update install scripts to support CLI options
* Add options for setting the maximum CPU time
* Update CUDALucas to support PRP tests and the Jacobi error check for LL tests
* Update Mlucas to support the Jacobi error check for LL tests
* Create a [Tensor Processing Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit) (TPU) GIMPS program and Google Colab TPU notebook (#3)

Thanks to [Daniel Connelly](https://github.com/Danc2050) for updating the PrimeNet Python script from Mlucas to eliminate the password requirement by getting assignments using the [PrimeNet API](http://v5.mersenne.org/v5design/v5webAPI_0.97.html) and to support reporting the assignment results and progress for CUDALucas using the PrimeNet API, for porting the Prime95 script to Python and for helping create and test the Google Colab Jupyter Notebooks!

Thanks to Ernst W. Mayer for helping test and for providing feedback on the Mlucas install script.
